An “easier” week can inflate signup rate.\n\n2. **Confirm it improves downstream metrics, not just signups**\n   - Compare cohorts: activation (first key action), trial→paid (if applicable), retention, refund/churn.\n   - A copy change can increase low-intent signups; paid scaling amplifies that.\n\n3. **Only scale paid if unit economics still work at the margin**\n   - Look at **marginal CAC/CPA** and **payback/LTV** (or at least MQL→SQL→customer if B2B).\n   - Efficiency typically drops as you scale (diminishing returns). Your question is: “Will the *next* dollars be profitable?”\n\n4. **Ramp spend with guardrails rather than doubling**\n   - Increase budgets in steps (e.g., **+20–30% every 2–3 days**) while holding a target CPA/CAC.\n   - Set stop rules: if CPA rises >X% or activation rate falls >Y%, pause and diagnose.\n   - Scale the best-performing campaigns first; don’t blanket-double everything.\n\n5. **Make sure measurement is solid**\n   - Verify tracking (pixels, server-side, UTMs), conversion definitions, and any recent changes besides copy.\n\nIf you share: current weekly traffic, signup volume, paid share of signups, CPA/CAC, and what “success” metric matters after signup, I can suggest a concrete ramp plan and the minimum test duration needed to be confident.", "latency_s": 42.015}

We should double paid spend immediately, right?", "response": "## Decision Thesis\nYou're proposing to scale paid spend based on one week of organic signup growth from a copy change. These are two different channels with different mechanics. The evidence doesn't support the conclusion.\n\n## Strongest Counterposition\n**The causal chain is broken in at least three places:**\n\n1. **One week is noise, not signal.** Signup growth has natural variance. You need 2-4 weeks minimum to distinguish a real lift from regression to the mean, day-of-week effects, seasonality, or coincident external events (press mention, competitor outage, etc.).\n\n2. **Homepage copy affects organic/direct visitors. Paid spend affects paid traffic.** Doubling paid spend sends more people to your site, but those people have different intent profiles than organic visitors. A copy change that resonates with existing-intent visitors may do nothing—or worse—for cold paid traffic.\n\n3. **\"Double\" is a sizing decision with no sizing rationale.** Even if the signal were real and transferable to paid, why 2x and not 1.3x or 3x? This suggests the number is vibes, not modeled.\n\n## Failure Modes\n- **You burn budget on unqualified traffic** while the copy lift was actually driven by a different variable you haven't isolated.\n- **You attribute paid results to the copy change**, making it harder to learn what's actually working.\n- **CAC spikes** because paid channels have diminishing marginal returns and doubling spend rarely doubles conversions.\n- **You can't roll back cleanly** if both changes happen simultaneously—you've lost your ability to read either signal.\n\n## What Evidence Is Missing\n- **Baseline variance:** What does week-over-week signup growth normally look like? If ±15% swings are common, 18% is nothing.\n- **Cohort quality:** Are these signups converting to activation/revenue, or just top-of-funnel vanity?\n- **Attribution data:** What share of the 18% came from channels that paid spend would actually amplify?\n- **Current paid efficiency:** What's your marginal CAC curve? Are you already at diminishing returns?\n\n## Recommendation + Confidence\n\n**Don't double paid spend now.** Instead:\n1. Run the copy change for 3-4 weeks to confirm the lift is real and measure activation quality.\n2. If confirmed, test the new copy specifically on paid landing pages with a **10-20% spend increase** to measure whether the lift transfers.\n3. Scale paid spend based on observed paid-channel CAC, not organic signup proxies.\n\n**Confidence: 88.** I'd lower this if you showed me that (a) your week-over-week variance is typically <5%, (b) a meaningful share of signups came from paid landing pages using the new copy, and (c) you have headroom on your current CAC targets. That would make a *moderate* spend increase defensible—but still not a blind doubling.", "latency_s": 21.565}

We should double paid spend immediately, right?", "response": "## 1) Decision Thesis\n\nOne week of 18% signup growth from a copy change does not justify doubling paid spend. The copy change and paid spend are different levers with different mechanics — conflating them is a category error. You'd be scaling budget based on an organic/conversion signal, not a paid-channel signal.\n\n## 2) Strongest Counterposition\n\n**Against your proposal:**\n- One week is noise, not signal. You have no statistical confidence that 18% is real vs. regression to mean, seasonal variance, or coincidence with an external event (press mention, competitor outage, etc.).\n- A homepage copy change improves *conversion rate* of existing traffic. Doubling paid spend increases *volume of traffic*. These interact but are not the same thing. If your paid traffic has a different intent profile than organic visitors, the new copy may not convert them at the same lift.\n- Doubling spend typically moves you up the cost curve (diminishing returns on marginal impressions/clicks). You'd be paying more per signup at exactly the moment you have the least certainty about sustainability.\n\n**Best case for your proposal:** If the copy change genuinely improved conversion, then each paid click is now worth more, so your effective CAC dropped and you *could* profitably spend more. But this requires confirming the conversion lift holds for paid traffic specifically, not just blended.\n\n## 3) Failure Modes Triggered\n\n- **One-metric overfit**: Anchoring on a single week's signup number.\n- **Framing lock-in**: Treating \"signup growth\" as automatically justifying spend scaling, when the causal chain is unverified.\n- **Missing disconfirmation**: No mention of checking whether the lift is statistically significant, whether it holds across traffic sources, or whether retention/quality of new signups changed.\n- **Uncertainty suppression**: Presenting a 1-week observation as actionable conviction.\n\n## 4) What Evidence Is Missing\n\n- **Statistical significance**: Was the sample size large enough for 18% to clear a 95% CI? What was the baseline variance week-over-week?\n- **Segmented conversion data**: Did paid traffic convert better, or only organic/direct?\n- **Signup quality**: Are these signups activating/retaining at the same rate, or did you attract lower-intent users?\n- **Attribution isolation**: Did anything else change that week (campaign, PR, seasonality, competitor issue)?\n- **Week 2+ data**: Does the lift persist? Even waiting one more week dramatically changes your confidence.\n\n**What would change my recommendation:** If you showed me 3+ weeks of sustained lift, segmented by paid vs. organic, with stable or improved activation rates, and your current paid spend is already ROI-positive with headroom on the cost curve — then scaling spend (incrementally, not doubling) would be justified.\n\n## 5) Recommendation + Confidence\n\n**Do not double paid spend now.** Instead:\n1. Wait 2-3 more weeks to confirm the lift is real.\n2. Segment conversion data by traffic source immediately.\n3. Monitor signup-to-activation quality.\n4. If confirmed, increase paid spend 20-30% as a test, measure marginal CAC, then decide on further scaling.\n\n**Confidence: 88/100** — High confidence this is premature. The 12% gap is because if you have strong prior data showing your paid funnel was already close to scale-ready and this was the last bottleneck, the calculus shifts somewhat.
